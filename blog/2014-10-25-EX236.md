# Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

This exam covers the subject of the Red Hat Storage Server product which is the commercially supported solution that Red Hat offers. If you want to study for this exam without having to purchase a support license there is a [solution][1] suggested by the GlusterFS team themselves: use the community version of glusterfs-server. Note: as firewall configuration is not an objective for this exam, I am assuming there is no firewall on either client or nodes in the following examples. 

The Gluster team provide a link to the main download site for GlusterFS but since I am using CentOS it will be easier to use the repo with yum. It wasn't obvious to me at first but there is a repo available for CentOS 7 buried a few levels deep:

    http://download.gluster.org/pub/gluster/glusterfs/LATEST/CentOS/glusterfs-epel.repo

This document is organized by objective as they are given by Red Hat. It is better to use this as a reference for each objective rather than a walkthrough. For example, the objective to create bricks comes **after** the objective to configure a storage pool. Normally you would create the bricks before adding them to a pool.

###  A quick note on terminology
A Gluser cluser is a group or "**pool**" of servers or "**nodes**" which are made of several shared filesystems or "**bricks**." A group of bricks make a "**volume**". A "**client**" is any device which accesses the resources available through the pools. More details can be found in the [common setup criteria][3].

# Deploy to physical and virtual hardware <a name="obj1"></a>
The first objective is: "_Deploy the Red Hat Storage Server appliance on both physical and virtual hardware and work with existing Red Hat Storage Server appliances._" 

I'm not actually sure what they mean by "deploy." For now I'm going to assume that they mean "install" so I'll describe installing the glusterfs-server on a node. 

There isn't any difference between installing on physical or virtual hardware, the difference will come in how the pools and bricks are configured. The docs on installing to [bare metal][4], for example, details the infastructure: DNS, network fabric, etc.

Once the repo (as described in the Introduction) is configured I can follow the guide provided by [Server World][2] to install and start the GlusterFS daemon. I will repeat this procedure for as many nodes as I want in the pool.

    [root@node1 ~]# yum install glusterfs-server -y
    [root@node1 ~]# systemctl start glusterd.service
    [root@node1 ~]# systemctl enable glusterd.service

# Configure a Red Hat Storage Server storage pool <a name="obj2"></a>

To create the pool, I'll name each node using a _node#_ pattern, `node1.pequeno.in`, `node2.pequeno.in`, etc. 	
    
Here, I tell the nodes to learn about each other. Once a node has been added to a pool it can inform other nodes about the ones it already knows about. When `node1` probed for `node2` I get one kind of success message:

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster peer probe node2.pequeno.in
    peer probe: success.

But when I ask `node3` to probe `node1` I get a different kind of success message since `node3` already knows about `node1`.
	
    [root@node3 ~]# gluster peer probe node1.pequeno.in
    peer probe: success. Host node1.pequeno.in port 24007 already in peer list
    

# Create individual storage bricks <a name="obj3"></a>
The full objective is: _Create individual storage bricks on either physical devices or logical volumes_. These are nodes with additional blocks of storage added to become the bricks. The added block storage is `/dev/xvdb` on each of the nodes.

    [root@node1 ~]# mkdir /glusterfs
    [root@node1 ~]# fdisk /dev/xvdb
    [root@node1 ~]# mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdb5
    [root@node1 ~]# mount /dev/xvdb5 /glusterfs
    [root@node1 ~]# tail -1 /etc/mtab >> /etc/fstab
    [root@node1 ~]# mkdir /glusterfs/distributed

# Create various Red Hat Storage Server volumes <a name="obj4"></a>
The full objective is:

_Create various Red Hat Storage Server volumes such as:_

* _Distributed_
* _Replicated_
* _Distributed-replicated_
* _Stripe-replicated_
* _Distributed-striped_ 
* _Distributed-striped-replicated_

I'll break them down into their own individual sections so I can focus more directly on each. This section borrows heavily from the "[Setting up GlusterFS Server Volumes][6]" guide provided by the Gluster team. For the examples I'll be using the same FQDNs (`node1.pequeno.in`) for each setup but for each section assume these are newly created pools and bricks.

### Distributed <a name="obj4-1"></a>

![distributed](/../img/ex236/Distributed_Volume.png)

Distributed is the default mode GlusterFS will use if I don't specify any other configuration. In this example I'm only giving name of the volume `vol_distributed`.  

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create vol_distributed \
    >node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed \
    >node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed \
    >node3.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed;
    volume create: vol_distributed: success: please start the volume to access data
     
Start the pool

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume start vol_distributed
    volume start: vol_distributed: success

Even though we started the volume on `node1`, I can check the status of the volume from any node in the pool. Here, I'm checking the status from `node2`.

    [root@node2 ~]# gluster volume info
    Volume Name: vol_distributed
    Type: Distribute
    Volume ID: 72e242ac-6fa8-49a1-a209-e20b80fe90fb
    Status: Started
    Number of Bricks: 3
    Transport-type: tcp
    Bricks:
    Brick1: node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed
    Brick2: node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed
    Brick3: node3.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed

### Replicated <a name="obj4-2"></a>

![replicated](/../img/ex236/Replicated_Volume.png)

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create replication1 replica 2 \
    node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/replicated \
    node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/replicated
    volume create: replication1: success: please start the volume to access data

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume start replication1
    volume start: replication1: success

I can check the status of the volume on `node2`:
    
    [root@node2 ~]# gluster volume info
    
    Volume Name: replication1
    Type: Replicate
    Volume ID: 75182cb0-07c5-4118-86c8-862f2a40d384
    Status: Started
    Number of Bricks: 1 x 2 = 2
    Transport-type: tcp
    Bricks:
    Brick1: node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/replicated
    Brick2: node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/replicated

### Distributed-replicated <a name="obj4-3"></a>

![distributed-replicated](/../img/ex236/Distributed_Replicated_Volume.png)

What is important to note about this configuration is that it is the exact syntax I used for the replicated volume. The difference is that I am providing more bricks (4) than the number of replication volumes (2). 

Gluster will replicate automatically across the first two nodes (`node1` and `node2` each get a copy of `file1`) and then distribute files on the latter nodes (`node3` and `node4` each get a copy of `file2`). 

It is also a better choice to have memebers of a replica set on different servers. While you could, you wouldn't want to have a physical device trying to replicate to itself. If they are on seperate physical volumes they are better protected against disk failure. 

An important note from the documentation:

> Note: The number of bricks should be a multiple of the replica count for a distributed replicated volume.

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create dist-repl replica 2 \
    >node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-replicated/ \
    >node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-replicated/ \
    >node3.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-replicated/ \
    >node4.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-replicated/;
    volume create: dist-repl: success: please start the volume to access data

    [root@node4 ~]# gluster volume info

    Volume Name: dist-repl
    Type: Distributed-Replicate
    Volume ID: 4a92e432-a1cc-419a-a6a7-7280854619c1
    Status: Started
    Number of Bricks: 2 x 2 = 4
    Transport-type: tcp
    Bricks:
    Brick1: node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-replicated
    Brick2: node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-replicated
    Brick3: node3.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-replicated
    Brick4: node4.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-replicated

### Stripe-replicated <a name="obj4-4"></a>

![striped-replicated](/../img/ex236/Striped_Replicated_Volume.png)

I'm not sure that image is labeled as clearly as it could be. When I send a file to the volume named `strp-repl` it will be distributed across 2 volumes with some of the data going to the first volume containing `node1` and `node2`. The rest of the data going to the second volume containing `node3` and `node4`. To call these replicated volumes is misleading since it's the bricks within the volumes that are replicated.

Data in each volume the data is replicated between the bricks. `node2` will be a duplicate of the data found on `node1`, and `node4` will be a duplicate of the data found on `node3`.

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create strp-repl stripe 2 replica 2 \
    >node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped-replicated/ \
    >node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped-replicated/ \
    >node3.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped-replicated/ \
    >node4.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped-replicated/;
    volume create: strp-repl: success: please start the volume to access data



    [root@node3 ~]# gluster volume info
    
    Volume Name: strp-repl
    Type: Striped-Replicate
    Volume ID: c002f35f-68ff-45de-9021-a4e77d68842f
    Status: Started
    Number of Bricks: 1 x 2 x 2 = 4
    Transport-type: tcp
    Bricks:
    Brick1: node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped-replicated
    Brick2: node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped-replicated
    Brick3: node3.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped-replicated
    Brick4: node4.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped-replicated

### Distributed-striped <a name="obj4-5"></a>

![distributed-striped](/../img/ex236/Distributed_Striped_Volume.png)

This example shows again how distribution is often implied. Here I'm asking GlusterFS to stripe across 2 but I'm giving it 4 bricks. GlusterFS will stripe `file1` across `node1` and `node2`, and `file2` will be striped across `node3` and `node4`.

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create dist-strp stripe 2 \
    >node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-striped/ \
    >node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-striped/ \
    >node3.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-striped/ \
    >node4.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-striped/;
    volume create: dist-strp: success: please start the volume to access data

    [root@node2 ~]# gluster volume info
    Volume Name: dist-strp
    Type: Distributed-Stripe
    Volume ID: 5ba0b6fb-8107-473c-88d6-40f75595b2c9
    Status: Started
    Number of Bricks: 2 x 2 = 4
    Transport-type: tcp
    Bricks:
    Brick1: node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-striped
    Brick2: node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-striped
    Brick3: node3.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-striped
    Brick4: node4.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed-striped

### Distributed-striped-replicated <a name="obj4-6"></a>

![distributed-striped-replicated](/../img/ex236/Distributed_Striped_Replicated_Volume.png)

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create dist-strp-repl stripe 2 replica 2 \
    >node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl/ \
    >node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl/ \
    >node3.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl/ \
    >node4.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl/ \
    >node5.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl/ \
    >node6.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl/ \
    >node7.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl/ \
    >node8.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl/;
    volume create: dist-strp-repl: success: please start the volume to access data

    [root@node2 ~]# gluster volume info    
    
    Volume Name: dist-strp-repl
    Type: Distributed-Striped-Replicate
    Volume ID: 2b93ca88-8dc9-401b-bc16-4041b9a733b5
    Status: Started
    Number of Bricks: 2 x 2 x 2 = 8
    Transport-type: tcp
    Bricks:
    Brick1: node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl
    Brick2: node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl
    Brick3: node3.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl
    Brick4: node4.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl
    Brick5: node5.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl
    Brick6: node6.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl
    Brick7: node7.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl
    Brick8: node8.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/dist-strp-repl

# Format the volumes with an appropriate file system <a name="obj5"></a>

Gluster is flexible when it comes to the type of file system you can format a volume with. The Gluster team suggest XFS or ext4 but there aren't very many restrictions from the Gluster side of the fence. 

Red Hat, on the other hand, makes a clear choice: [XFS][5]. 

> Red Hat supports only formatting a Logical Volume by using the XFS file system on the bricks with few modifications to improve performance. Ensure to format bricks using XFS on Logical Volume Manager before adding it to a Red Hat Storage volume. 

From the documentation, you should format the device with the following command:

    # mkfs.xfs -i size=512 <DEVICE>

# Extend existing storage volumes <a name="obj6"></a>
_Extend existing storage volumes by adding additional bricks and performing appropriate rebalancing operations_

The objectives for this exam don't specify that we should know how to configure a strictly striped volume but I believe that is a useful configuration to test a rebalancing operation.

I'll be using a new `node1` and `node2` for this example. 

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster peer probe node2.pequeno.in
    peer probe: success. 
    [root@node1 ~]# gluster peer status
    Number of Peers: 1

    Hostname: node2.pequeno.in
    Uuid: 4ce512c2-00d2-4a36-8651-7885588e495a
    State: Peer in Cluster (Connected)

Now I'll create a brick on each of the nodes, I'm only showing the commands entered for `node1`, the exact commands are to be duplicated on `node2`.

    [root@node1 ~]# fdisk /dev/xvdb
    [root@node1 ~]# mkfs.xfs -i size=512 /dev/xvdb5
    [root@node1 ~]# mkdir /glusterfs
    [root@node1 ~]# mount /dev/xvdb5 /glusterfs/
    [root@node1 ~]# mkdir /glusterfs/striped

I can now create the striped volume `strp-vol`

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create strp-vol stripe 2 \
    > node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped \
    > node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped;
    volume create: strp-vol: success: please start the volume to access data
    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume start strp-vol
    volume start: strp-vol: success

    [root@gluster ~]# gluster volume info
     
    Volume Name: strp-vol
    Type: Stripe
    Volume ID: 5b54ba8c-706c-48fa-bdf3-befd19095916
    Status: Started
    Number of Bricks: 1 x 2 = 2
    Transport-type: tcp
    Bricks:
    Brick1: node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped
    Brick2: node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped

I'll have a client use this volume. The gluster docs on installing the native client don't seem to be up to date. They ask to [install][7] the `openib` package but that is no longer included in RHEL. It seems as though that package has been replaced but is not needed unless you are planning to use [infiniband][8].

The gluster docs say to install several packages for the native client but I didn't have much luck that way. I did have success using the instructions from [this][11] guide from server-world.

    [root@client ~]# wget http://download.gluster.org/pub/gluster/glusterfs/LATEST/CentOS/glusterfs-epel.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/glusterfs-epel.repo 
    [root@client ~]# yum install glusterfs glusterfs-fuse -y
    [root@client ~]# mkdir gluster
    [root@client ~]# mount -t glusterfs node1.pequeno.in:/strp-vol gluster/
    [root@client gluster]# df -h
    Filesystem                  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/xvda1                   20G  1.4G   18G   8% /
    devtmpfs                    238M     0  238M   0% /dev
    tmpfs                       243M     0  243M   0% /dev/shm
    tmpfs                       243M  4.3M  239M   2% /run
    tmpfs                       243M     0  243M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
    node1.pequeno.in:/strp-vol  200G   65M  200G   1% /root/gluster

I'll create a bunch of dummy files:

    [root@client gluster]# for i in {1..100}; do dd if=/dev/urandom of=$i bs=1M count=1;done

Finally, I can get to the heart of the issue: adding a brick and rebalancing. An important thing to note from [this][12] guide:

> Note: When expanding distributed replicated and distributed striped volumes, you need to add a number of bricks that is a multiple of the replica or stripe count. For example, to expand a distributed replicated volume with a replica count of 2, you need to add bricks in multiples of 2 (such as 4, 6, 8, etc.). 

If I attempt to use just 1 brick, I'll get the following error:

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume add-brick strp-vol node1.pequeno.in:/newbrick/
    volume add-brick: failed: Incorrect number of bricks supplied 1 with count 2

So I'll create new bricks on `node2` like this:

    [root@node2 ~]# fdisk /dev/xvdd
    [root@node2 ~]# mkfs.xfs -i size=512 /dev/xvdd5 
    [root@node2 ~]# mkdir /newbrick
    [root@node2 ~]# mount /dev/xvdd5 /to-be-added/
    [root@node2 ~]# cd /to-be-added/
    [root@node2 to-be-added]# mkdir brick1
    [root@node2 to-be-added]# mkdir brick2

Now on `node1` I will add the 2 new bricks to the volume:

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume add-brick strp-vol \
    > node2.pequeno.in:/to-be-added/brick1 \
    > node2.pequeno.in:/to-be-added/brick2;

This changes the type of the volume to `Distributed-Stripe`:

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume info
     
    Volume Name: strp-vol
    Type: Distributed-Stripe
    Volume ID: 79ecfcbf-c1d0-4d7a-94e1-78f670a12e0d
    Status: Started
    Number of Bricks: 2 x 2 = 4
    Transport-type: tcp
    Bricks:
    Brick1: node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped
    Brick2: node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/striped
    Brick3: node2.pequeno.in:/to-be-added/brick1
    Brick4: node2.pequeno.in:/to-be-added/brick2

Now, we can rebalance:

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume rebalance strp-vol start
    volume rebalance: strp-vol: success: Starting rebalance on volume strp-vol has been successful.
    ID: 2a86a8bd-c4f0-42bb-b76e-d4aa1be64ea0
    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume rebalance strp-vol status
    Node              Rebalanced-files  size          scanned      failures       skipped        status          run time in secs

# Configure clients to use NFS <a name="obj7"></a>
_Configure clients to use Red Hat Storage Server appliance volumes using native and network file systems (NFS)_

This objective is very straight-forward. If you've set up NFS on RHEL before the process is identical, and there is no considerable difference on the node side of things. 

First, `node1`:

    [root@node1 ~]# yum install glusterfs-server -y
    [root@node1 ~]# fdisk /dev/xvdb
    [root@node1 ~]# mkfs.xfs -i size=512 /dev/xvdb5
    [root@node1 ~]# mkdir /glusterfs
    [root@node1 ~]# mount /dev/xvdb5 /glusterfs/
    [root@node1 ~]# mkdir /glusterfs/distributed
    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create dist \
    > node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed/;
    volume create: dist: success: please start the volume to access data
    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume start dist
    volume start: dist: success

Then the `client`:
    
    [root@client ~]# yum install nfs-utils -y
    [root@client ~]# mkdir remote
    [root@client ~]# mount -t nfs node1.pequeno.in:/dist remote/
    [root@client ~]# touch remote/testfile


We can verify the file `testfile` was created on `node1`:

    [root@node1 ~]# ls /glusterfs/distributed/
    testfile

That's about it!

# Configure clients to use SMB <a name="obj8"></a>
_Configure clients to use Red Hat Storage Server appliance volumes using SMB_

To configure clients to use SMB the process is nearly identical to the way that you would configure a typical SMB share.

> Note: You must repeat these steps on each Gluster node. For more advanced configurations, see Samba documentation.

First, `node1`:

    [root@node1 ~]# yum install glusterfs-server -y
    [root@node1 ~]# fdisk /dev/xvdb
    [root@node1 ~]# mkfs.xfs -i size=512 /dev/xvdb5
    [root@node1 ~]# mkdir /glusterfs
    [root@node1 ~]# mount /dev/xvdb5 /glusterfs/
    [root@node1 ~]# mkdir /glusterfs/distributed
    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create dist \
    > node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed/;
    volume create: dist: success: please start the volume to access data
    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume start dist
    volume start: dist: success

Now, still on `node1` we'll have to configure Samba as well. There are ways to create public samba shares that do not require a username and password for authentication but that leads a little further into a lesson on how Samba works rather than gluster, so I'll just create a user to test this configuration.


    [root@node1 ~]# yum install samba samba-client -y
    [root@node1 ~]# vim /etc/samba/smb.conf 
    [root@node1 ~]# useradd gfstest
    [root@node1 ~]# smbpasswd -a gfstest
    Added user gfstest.
    [root@node1 ~]# systemctl restart smb.service
    [root@node1 ~]# testparm
    Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
    rlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)
    Processing section "[gluster]"
    Loaded services file OK.
    Server role: ROLE_STANDALONE
    Press enter to see a dump of your service definitions
    
    [global]
        workgroup = MYGROUP
        server string = Samba Server Version %v
        log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
        max log size = 50
        idmap config * : backend = tdb
        cups options = raw
    
    [gluster]
        comment = Gluster over SMB!
        path = /glusterfs/distributed
        valid users = gfstest
        read only = No
        guest ok = Yes

What I'm about to do is BAD AND NOT RECOMENDED but to simplify permission issues I'm going to make /glusterfs/distributed accessible to everyone and everything. This step is necessary if you want to be able to write to the share.

    [root@node1 ~]# chmod -R 777 /glusterfs/distributed/


Now I can configure the client to look for that CIFS share:

   [root@client ~]# yum install cifs-utils -y
   [root@client ~]# mount -t cifs //node1.pequeno.in/gluster -o rw,username=gfstest,password=123456 sambashare/
   [root@client ~]# cd sambashare/
   [root@client sambashare]# touch testfile
   [root@client sambashare]# ls
   testfile


# Configure quotas and ACLs <a name="obj9"></a>
_Configure Red Hat Storage Server features including disk quotas and POSIX access control lists (ACLs)_

I'll begin by configuring `node1` and `node2` similarly:
 
    [root@node1 ~]# yum install glusterfs-server -y
    [root@node1 ~]# fdisk /dev/xvdb
    [root@node1 ~]# mkfs.xfs -i size=512 /dev/xvdb5
    [root@node1 ~]# mkdir /glusterfs
    [root@node1 ~]# mount /dev/xvdb5 /glusterfs/
    [root@node1 ~]# mkdir /glusterfs/distributed

I'll make some changes specifically on `node1`

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create dist \
    > node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed/ \
    > node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/distributed/;
    volume create: dist: success: please start the volume to access data
    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume start dist
    volume start: dist: success
    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume quota dist enable
    volume quota : success
    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume quota dist limit-usage / 2GB
    volume quota : success

I'll configure the client this way:

    [root@client ~]# wget http://download.gluster.org/pub/gluster/glusterfs/LATEST/CentOS/glusterfs-epel.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/glusterfs-epel.repo 
    [root@client ~]# yum install glusterfs glusterfs-fuse -y
    [root@client ~]# mkdir gfs
    [root@client ~]# mount -t glusterfs node1.pequeno.in:/dist gfs/

And when I try to write a file that is larger than the 2GB limit put in place:

    [root@client gfs]# dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=1M count=3000
    dd: error writing ‘bigfile’: Disk quota exceeded
    dd: closing output file ‘bigfile’: Disk quota exceeded
    [root@client gfs]# ls -lh
    total 2.1G
    -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2.1G Oct 19 00:25 bigfile


There are two types of ACLs available for use with gluster, 'access' and 'default'.

> You can set two types of POSIX ACLs, that is, access ACLs and default ACLs. You can use access ACLs to grant permission for a specific file or directory. You can use default ACLs only on a directory but if a file inside that directory does not have an ACLs, it inherits the permissions of the default ACLs of the directory. [gluster.org][14]

To enable ACLs from the client side, we have to mount the drive using the `acl` option.

    [root@client gfs]# mkdir allow
    [root@client gfs]# mkdir deny
    [root@client gfs]# useradd alice
    [root@client ~]# mkdir /home/shared
    [root@client ~]# mount -t glusterfs -o acl node1.pequeno.in:/dist /home/shared/

On the server we must create the users as well. There, we can create the ACLs:

    [root@node1 distributed]# useradd alice
    [root@node1 distributed]# setfacl -m u:alice:rwx allow/
    [root@node1 distributed]# setfacl -m u:alice:--- deny/

From the client we can see the effect of these changes:
   
    [root@client ~]# su alice
    [alice@client root]$ cd /home/shared/
    [alice@client shared]$ ls
    allow  deny
    [alice@client shared]$ cd allow/
    [alice@client allow]$ touch alicefile
    [alice@client allow]$ ls
    alicefile
    [alice@client allow]$ cd ..
    [alice@client shared]$ cd deny/
    bash: cd: deny/: Permission denied
    [alice@client shared]$ getfacl allow/
    # file: allow/
    # owner: root
    # group: root
    user::rwx
    user:alice:rwx
    user:bob:rwx
    group::r-x
    mask::rwx
    other::r-x

# Configure IP failover for NFS-and SMB-based cluster services <a name="obj10"></a>

This section will follow the Red Hat [documentation][15] on this subject very closely. If there is anything that I do not cover with adequate detail I would look there first for further clarification.

During the installation of the client I came across this:

    [root@client ~]# mount -t glusterfs node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/strp-vol gluster/
    Mount failed. Please check the log file for more details.

The relevant lines from the logs read:

    [2014-10-13 22:41:14.567433] E [glusterfsd-mgmt.c:1297:mgmt_getspec_cbk] 0-glusterfs: failed to get the 'volume file' from server
    [2014-10-13 22:41:14.567480] E [glusterfsd-mgmt.c:1398:mgmt_getspec_cbk] 0-mgmt: failed to fetch volume file (key:/glusterfs/strp-vol)

A quick google search came up with [this][9] mailing list thread which solves the issue with changing some security settings. Making those changes did not solve the issue for me but [this][10] blog post pointed out that the problem was much more simple. As it turns out, I was attempting to mount using the path when I really just needed to pass the name of the volume:

    [root@client ~]# mount -t glusterfs node1.pequeno.in:/strp-vol gluster/

While writing the quotas section I came across this message:

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume quota dist limit-usage /glusterfs/distributed/ 5GB
    quota command failed : Failed to get trusted.gfid attribute on path /glusterfs/distributed/. Reason : No such file or directory

Again I had a syntax error. The gluster docs [say][13]:

> The directory name should be relative to the volume with the export directory/mount being treated as "/". 

So the command I should have ran was:

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume quota dist limit-usage / 5GB

Which will limit the usage of all of `dist` to 5GB

While writing the IP failover section I accidentally used a volume before probing for peers. When I tried to use those bricks again I got the following error:

    [root@node1 ~]# gluster volume create repl replica 2 \
    > node1.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/replicated/ \
    > node2.pequeno.in:/glusterfs/replicated/;
    volume create: repl: failed: /glusterfs/replicated is already part of a volume

This is a common issue, having to remove bricks for use in another (or in this case the same) volume. In my opinion the [solution][16] is ugly and for me it didn't actually work.

I had to `rm -rf /glusterfs/replicated` and recreate that directory before things would work again. YMMV.
