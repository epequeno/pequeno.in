# Network Services

This is the second in a three part series covering the objectives for the Red Hat Certified Engineer (RCHE, EX300) exam.

# Install the packages <a name="obj1"></a>

The full objective is: _Install the packages needed to provide the service._

This seems like a very generic objective. I'll outline a general approach to installing the packages and ensuring they are started on boot. These steps will be similar for any service you wish to install on a given system.

    [root@netserv ~]# yum search ntp
    [root@netserv ~]# yum install ntp
    
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl list-unit-files | grep ntp
    ntpd.service                              disabled
    ntpdate.service                           disabled     
    
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl enable ntpd.service 
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ntpd.service'
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl start ntpd.service 

    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl list-unit-files | grep ntp
    ntpd.service                              enabled 
    ntpdate.service                           disabled

# Configure SELinux to support the service <a name="obj2"></a>

Everybody's favorite thing in the world, SELinux. First, let's make sure it's on and doing its thing:

    [root@netserv ~]# getenforce
    Permissive

We need to change it to `Enforcing` so we'll edit the SELinux config file to make sure we boot into `Enforcing` and we'll use `setenforce 1` to make SELinux enforce rules during this session:

    [root@netserv ~]# vim /etc/selinux/config 
    SELINUX=enforcing
    [root@netserv ~]# setenforce 1

Rather than put all the particular SELinux configurations here, I'll note any needed configs in the section that pertains to that service.

# Use SELinux port labeling to allow services to use non-standard ports <a name="obj3"></a>

See the previous section.

# Configure the service to start when the system is booted <a name="obj4"></a>

See the [first section](#obj1)

# Configure the service for basic operation <a name="obj5"></a>

Typically Red Hat only expects you to have the service installed and running with very little configuration. "Basic operation" also implies that the service should not be blocked by SELinux or firewall rules to be sure to understand all the aspects of what makes the service function.

# Configure host-based and user-based security for the service <a name="obj6"></a>

RHEL 7, as with previous versions can use either firewalls or [TCP Wrapper][2] to configure host-based security. Some services like SMB and HTTPD can make restrictions based on users. This objective basically means that you should be aware of the various ways that you can restrict the given service.

# HTTP/HTTPS <a name="obj7"></a>

This objective covers the [Apache][3] web server. There are a few significant differences between the 2.4.x version of apache that came with RHEL 6 and the 2.4.x version that comes with RHEL 7.

    [root@netserv ~]# httpd -v
    Server version: Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS)
    Server built:   Jul 23 2014 14:48:00

First, lets get it installed. Note that we also install the httpd-manual so we can have reference material available to us when needed:

    [root@netserv ~]# yum install httpd httpd-manual -y
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl enable httpd.service 
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service'
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl start httpd.service 


## Configure a VirtualHost <a name="obj7-1"></a>

I'll be using my domain powertra.in for these examples.

First things first, we should look at the docs that were installed with `httpd-manual`. In this case I'll go the url http://powertrain/manual The instructions that we need are at the bottom of the middle column of links. We'll be setting up named based VirtualHosts.

With Apache 2.2 we had to use the [NameVirtualHost][4] directive. It looks like that directive no longer has any [effect][5] in Apache 2.4. 

> The NameVirtualHost directive no longer has any effect, other than to emit a warning. Any address/port combination appearing in multiple virtual hosts is implicitly treated as a name-based virtual host. 

Good news for us since this is less work. We can get straight to making our VirtualHost configuration files:

    [root@netserv ~]# cd /etc/httpd/conf.d/
    [root@netserv conf.d]# cat powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName powertra.in
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in
    </VirtualHost>
    
    [root@netserv conf.d]# cat beta.powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName beta.powertra.in
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/beta.powertra.in	
    </VirtualHost>

    [root@netserv conf.d]# cd /var/www/vhosts/

    [root@netserv vhosts]# tree
    .
    ├── beta.powertra.in
    │   └── index.html
    └── powertra.in
        └── index.html
    
    2 directories, 2 files

Each of those index files has a few words to make sure they are distinct. I can now go to powertra.in and beta.powertra.in both of which resolve to the same IP address and get different content for each.

In order to get some SELinux in the mix, let's configure a site on a non-standard port. We can see the ports that SELinux is aware of using `semanage`:

    [root@denmark ~]# semanage port -l | grep http
    http_cache_port_t              tcp      8080, 8118, 8123, 10001-10010
    http_cache_port_t              udp      3130
    http_port_t                    tcp      80, 81, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000
    pegasus_http_port_t            tcp      5988
    pegasus_https_port_t           tcp      5989

I'd like to use one that isn't already configured so I'll use 8125.

We can use the man pages to get the information we need, in fact it has the specific example that we need already.

    [root@denmark ~]# man semanage-port
    ...
    Allow Apache to listen on tcp port 81
    # semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 81
    ...

We'll modify it for the port we're looking for:

    [root@denmark ~]# semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8125
    [root@denmark ~]# semanage port -l | grep 8125
    http_port_t                    tcp      8125, 80, 81, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000
    steven@jupiter ~ > curl http://powertra.in:8125
    Hello from port 8125!

Now let's serve some content out of a non-standard location `/website`. As it turns out this is a bit more involved than it was for RHEL 6. We now need to configure some access control directives for non-standard directories. This [blog][14] was able to provide the solution when I got stuck.

    [root@denmark ~]# mkdir /website
    [root@denmark ~]# echo "OMG SO NON STANDARD" > /website/index.html
    [root@denmark ~]# ls -Z / | grep website
    drwxr-xr-x. root root unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 website
    [root@denmark ~]# ls -Z /website/
    -rw-r--r--. root root unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 index.html

Let's create the VirtualHost file for this site, note the `<Directory>` block which will produce 403 errors regardless of SELinux configuration if omitted:

    [root@denmark httpd]# cd conf.d/
    [root@denmark conf.d]# cat non.powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName non.powertra.in
        DocumentRoot /website
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <Directory /website>
        Options All
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

And the result, a 403 (caused by SELinux):
    
    [root@denmark ~]# curl -I http://non.powertra.in
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    Date: Fri, 28 Nov 2014 03:24:48 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS)
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

Let's adjust the SELinux contexts Remember to check the man page for `semanage-fcontext` to get the example you should use to make the change permanent, using `chcon` as in this example will NOT persist a reboot.

    [root@denmark ~]# chcon --reference=/var/www /website/
    [root@denmark ~]# ls -Z / | grep website
    drwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 website
    [root@denmark ~]# chcon --reference=/var/www/vhosts/powertra.in/index.html /website/index.html 

And now we can see our content:

    [root@denmark ~]# curl non.powertra.in
    OMG SO NON STANDARD

## Configure private directories <a name="obj7-2"></a>

By 'private' I believe they mean password protected directories. Again, we'll look to the manual. We are looking for the 'Authentication and Authorization' guide which is at the top of the 3rd column. 

Let's start by creating a directory with some super secret stuff inside:

    [root@netserv powertra.in]# pwd
    /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in
    [root@netserv powertra.in]# mkdir secret
    [root@netserv powertra.in]# cd secret/
    [root@netserv secret]# echo "secret stuff" > index.html

Now we can create (`-c`) a file named `passwords` for apache to check against.

    [root@netserv httpd]# pwd
    /etc/httpd
    [root@netserv httpd]# htpasswd -c passwords steven
    New password: 
    Re-type new password: 
    Adding password for user steven

Now we'll modify the powertra.in configuration file:

    [root@netserv httpd]# cd ../httpd/conf.d/
    [root@netserv conf.d]# vim powertra.in.conf 
    [root@netserv conf.d]# cat powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName powertra.in
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <Directory /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in/secret>
	    AuthType Basic
	    AuthName "SUPER SECRET STUFF HERE"
	    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/passwords
	    Require user steven
    </Directory>

Now, when I try to go to powertra.in/secret I'll be asked to provide my user name `steven` and password.

## Deploy a basic CGI application <a name="obj7-3"></a>

Again, the manual gives us everything we need to complete this objective, this time the link that we're looking for (in my case) is http://powertra.in/manual/howto/cgi.html

Really, this is very simple since apache is already configured the way you need it to be to complete this objective. 

    [root@netserv ~]# cd /var/www/cgi-bin/
    [root@netserv cgi-bin]# ll
    total 4
    -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 76 Nov 25 04:04 first.pl
    [root@netserv cgi-bin]# cat first.pl 
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
    print "Hello, World.";

All I did was create a file in `/var/www/cgi-bin/` named `first.pl` and made it executable. From there I can go to powertra.in/cgi-bin/first.pl and see my output, meaning that my CGI "application" has worked.

## Configure group-managed content<a name="obj7-4"></a>

This is essentially the same process we use in setting a password protected directory. This time around we're gonna create a group file which will allow us to use similar setting for a group of users.

First, let's add some users to the `passwords` file we created earlier and then add them to a `groups` file which defines the group name and who belongs to the group. In this case our group will be named `sales`:

    [root@netserv httpd]# pwd
    /etc/httpd
    [root@netserv httpd]# htpasswd passwords tom
    New password: 
    Re-type new password: 
    Adding password for user tom
    [root@netserv httpd]# htpasswd passwords sally
    New password: 
    Re-type new password: 
    Adding password for user sally
    [root@netserv httpd]# htpasswd passwords bill
    New password: 
    Re-type new password: 
    Adding password for user bill
    
    [root@netserv httpd]# vim groups
    [root@netserv httpd]# cat groups 
    sales: tom sally bill

And let's make some content the group should have access to:

    [root@netserv beta.powertra.in]# pwd
    /var/www/vhosts/beta.powertra.in
    [root@netserv beta.powertra.in]# mkdir group
    [root@netserv beta.powertra.in]# echo "group stuff" > group/index.html

And make our directory configuration in the beta.powertra.in conf file:

    [root@netserv conf.d]# pwd
    /etc/httpd/conf.d
    [root@netserv conf.d]# vim beta.powertra.in.conf 
    [root@netserv conf.d]# cat beta.powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName beta.powertra.in
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/beta.powertra.in	
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <Directory /var/www/vhosts/beta.powertra.in/group>
	    AuthType Basic
	    AuthName "GROUP PEEPS ONLY"
	    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/passwords
	    AuthGroupFile /etc/httpd/groups
	    Require group sales
    </Directory>

Now if we try going to beta.powertra.in/group/ we will be asked to provide a user name and password, we can use any that we defined in the `groups` file (`tom`, `sally` or `bill`) but the user `steven` would not be able to get in since he's not a member of the `sales` group.

## Configure TLS security<a name="obj7-5"></a>

For this we'll need to install some extra packages `mod_ssl` will allow apache to use keys and certs. We will have to generate our own self-signed certs for this example. You could use the `openssl` tool but that is too complex for the purposes of this test. The `crypto-utils` package gives us the `genkey` tool which makes generating a key much easier and saves time (in my opinion).

    [root@netserv ~]# yum install mod_ssl crypto-utils -y
    [root@netserv ~]# genkey --days 365 powertra.in

Once we have our keys created we'll have to configure the VirtualHost to use TLS. I have removed the `ssl.conf` file that was provided with `mod_ssl` So I've had to put the `Listen 443 https` directive here. 

A side note: I originally made a cert with a key length of 512 bits, I wasn't able to test this in firefox 33 since keys smaller than 1024 bits are no longer accepted. I was able to test the site with elinks and everything worked from the server side. I made another key with length 2048 and firefox liked that one just fine.

    [root@netserv conf.d]# pwd
    /etc/httpd/conf.d
    [root@netserv conf.d]# cat powertra.in.conf 
    <VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerName powertra.in
	    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <Directory /var/www/vhosts/powertra.in/secret>
	    AuthType Basic
	    AuthName "SUPER SECRET STUFF HERE"
	    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/passwords
	    Require user steven
    </Directory>
    
    Listen 443 https
    
    <VirtualHost *:443>
	    ServerName powertra.in
	    SSLEngine on
	    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/powertra.in.crt
	    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/powertra.in.key
    </VirtualHost>

The important thing to notice is that I have placed the `Listen 443 https` directive here and have told apache to ignore the default `ssl.conf` that gets installed with the `mod_ssl` package. I like to do it this way to reduce the number of places I may have to troubleshoot if a problem comes up.    

# DNS <a name="obj8"></a>

Fortunately, the test doesn't require us to configure a DNS server to any great degree. 
    
## Configure a caching-only name server<a name="obj8-1"></a>

Let me quote Michael Jang from his [book][7]: 

> When configuring a caching-only name server, the first step is to look at the default version of the /etc/named.conf configuration file. The directives in the default version of this file are organized to set up a caching-only nameserver.

There are several packages associated with DNS, to simplify things I normally install what is needed this way:

    [root@netserv ~]# yum install bind*
    Installing:
    bind
    bind-chroot
    bind-devel 
    bind-dyndb-ldap 
    bind-lite-devel
    bind-sdb-chroot

Once it's installed we perform the normal steps to "enable" and start the service.

    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl enable named.service 
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/named.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/named.service'
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl start named.service

## Troubleshoot DNS client issues<a name="obj8-1"></a>

Here we should be familiar with how to use the `host`, `dig`, and `nslookup` commands. We should also be familiar with how the DNS system works. Remember to check firewall rules and the `/etc/hosts` file and `/etc/nsswitch.conf` files for any configurations that may cause issues.

# NFS<a name="obj9"></a>

For this section I'll be following along with this [guide][8] from unixmen.com.

## Provide network shares to specific clients<a name="obj9-1"></a>

Let's get NFS installed:

    [root@netserv ~]# yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib -y
    [root@netserv ~]# for i in rpcbind nfs-server nfs-lock nfs-idmap; do systemctl enable $i; done
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/nfs-server.service' '/etc/systemd/system/nfs.target.wants/nfs-server.service'
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/nfs-idmap.service' '/etc/systemd/system/nfs.target.wants/nfs-idmap.service'
    [root@netserv ~]# for i in rpcbind nfs-server nfs-lock nfs-idmap; do systemctl start $i; done
    [root@netserv ~]# mkdir /var/nfs-share
    [root@netserv ~]# chmod 777 /var/nfs-share/
    
Now, I can edit the `/etc/exports` file to specify the host I want to share this resource with. In this example I'm using the IP address of the `tester` host but I could also use a FQDN here as well.

    [root@netserv ~]# vim /etc/exports
    [root@netserv ~]# cat /etc/exports
    /var/nfs-share 166.78.138.141(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl restart nfs-server
    [root@netserv ~]# touch /var/nfs-share/lolfile
    [root@netserv ~]# exportfs -avr
    exporting 166.78.138.141:/var/nfs-share

Now we can go to our client machine and make sure that we can use the remote resource.

    [root@tester ~]# ip a | grep h0$ | awk '{print $2}'
    166.78.138.141/24
    [root@tester ~]# yum install nfs-utils -y
    [root@tester ~]# showmount -e 166.78.138.20
    Export list for 166.78.138.20:
    /var/nfs-share *
    [root@tester ~]# mkdir /my-mount
    [root@tester ~]# mount -t nfs 166.78.138.20:/var/nfs-share /my-mount/
    [root@tester ~]# ls /my-mount/
    lolfile

## Provide network shares suitable for group collaboration<a name="obj9-2"></a>

CertDepot has a good [guide][9] on this objective. In general, we are going to make a directory that is owned by a particular group then export that directory. 

    [root@netserv ~]# mkdir /shared
    [root@netserv ~]# groupadd -g 60000 sharedgrp
    [root@netserv ~]# chgrp sharedgrp /shared/
    [root@netserv ~]# chmod 2770 /shared/
    [root@netserv ~]# vim /etc/exports
    [root@netserv ~]# cat /etc/exports
    /var/nfs-share 166.78.138.141(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)
    /shared 166.78.138.141(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl restart nfs-server
    [root@netserv ~]# exportfs -avr
    exporting 166.78.138.141:/shared
    exporting 166.78.138.141:/var/nfs-share

Notice that we create the directory with the sticky-bit set so that any new file created in this folder maintains group ownership.

## Use Kerberos to control access to NFS network shares<a name="obj9-3"></a>

CertDepot has another great [guide][10] on this subject as well. We'll need a KDC (Kerberos Distribution Center) as well as an NFS server. If you want to get a KDC set up quickly and easily, take a look at [freeIPA][11]. I won't cover that process here since I'm not sure that is a part of the RHCE exam. The documentation at the freeIPA site is great and the setup shouldn't take more than a half hour at most.

After adding the principal NFS server the KDC, we'll export a directory as we would normally but this time we'll use the option `sec=krb5`. Using this option will force the client to authenticate using kerberos before being allowed to use the exported directory.

# SMB <a name="obj10"></a>

SAMBA or CIFS has not changed much since RHEL 6 but as with NFS we now have an objective which asks us to restrict a resource using kerberos.

## Provide network shares to specific clients<a name="obj10-1"></a>

This objective is identical to the RHEL 6 version. Here I'm making a share available to the user `steven`. That user will still be restricted by the system permissions so in order to let them write to the share, they will have to own the folder. In the next section we'll cover making a share for group work.

A gotcha that didn't make sense to me was that you need to install `samba-client` to get `smbpasswd`. This [site][15] solved that one for me.

    [root@samba ~]# yum install samba samba-client -y; iptables -F
    [root@samba ~]# useradd steven
    [root@samba ~]# smbpasswd -a steven
    [root@samba ~]# mkdir /sharedfiles
    [root@samba ~]# touch /sharedfiles/lolfile
    [root@samba ~]# chown steven:steven -R /sharedfiles/
    [root@samba ~]# vim /etc/samba/smb.conf
    [root@samba ~]# cat /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep -Ev "^[;#]|^$"
    [global]
    workgroup = MYGROUP
    server string = Samba Server Version %v
    log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
    max log size = 50
    security = user
    passdb backend = tdbsam
    load printers = yes
    cups options = raw
    
    [myshare]
    comment = MyShare
    path = /sharedfiles
    browseable = yes
    writable = yes
    valid users = steven

    [root@samba ~]# testparm
    [root@samba ~]# systemctl enable smb.service 
    [root@samba ~]# systemctl start smb.service

## Provide network shares suitable for group collaboration<a name="obj10-2"></a>

Similar to the NFS objective, we're going to create a shared directory with the sticky bit set. I'm going to follow along with this [guide][16] from CertDepot.

    [root@samba ~]# groupadd rhce
    [root@samba ~]# mkdir /rhcefiles
    [root@samba ~]# chgrp rhce /rhcefiles/
    [root@samba ~]# ls -l / | grep rhce
    drwxr-xr-x.   2 root rhce  4096 Dec  6 20:28 rhcefiles
    [root@samba ~]# chmod 2775 /rhcefiles/
    [root@samba ~]# ls -l / | grep rhce
    drwxr-sr-x.   2 root rhce  4096 Dec  6 20:28 rhcefiles
    [root@samba ~]# touch /rhcefiles/testfile
    [root@samba ~]# ll /rhcefiles/
    total 0
    -rw-r--r--. 1 root rhce 0 Dec  6 20:30 testfile

Now we'll create a couple of users for that group and configure samba for collaboration.

    [root@samba ~]# yum install samba samba-client -y  
    [root@samba samba]# cat smb.conf
    [global]
        workgroup = MYGROUP
        server string = Samba Server Version %v
        log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
        max log size = 50
        security = user
        passdb backend = tdbsam
        load printers = yes
        cups options = raw
    [shared]
        comment = Shared Files
        path = /rhcefiles
        browseable = no
        writable = yes
        valid users = @rhce
    [root@samba ~]# useradd -g rhce alice
    [root@samba ~]# useradd -g rhce bob
    [root@samba ~]# smbpasswd -a alice
    [root@samba ~]# smbpasswd -a bob

Now on the client I can simply use `cifs-utils` to mount the remote share.

    [root@client ~]# mkdir /sambashare
    [root@client ~]# mount -t cifs //104.130.174.217/shared /sambashare/ -o rw,username=alice,password=redhat
    [root@client ~]# cd /sambashare/
    [root@client sambashare]# ls
    ls: reading directory .: Permission denied

Now we're coming into some SELinux issues. Even though the user is part of the group, has authenticated and has successfully mounted the remote share, they are not allowed to do anything useful with it. Let's fix that. 

An important tip for the exam is that SELinux directives for SAMBA are in the `smb.conf` file that ships with the package. Make sure to reference it since it speaks directly to which file context we should use for this particular case.

> If you create a new directory, such as a new top-level directory, label it with samba_share_t so that SELinux allows Samba to read and write to it. Do not label system directories, such as /etc/ and /home/, with samba_share_t, as such directories should already have an SELinux label.

However, that document suggests using `chcon` but that is only temporary: changes made using `chcon` will not persist a reboot for the exam so we'll have to use `semanage` to make the changes permanent. Remember to check the man page for `semanage-fcontext` to get the example you should use to make the change permanent. 

    remember to run restorecon after you set the file context
       Add file-context for everything under /web
       # semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/web(/.*)?"
       # restorecon -R -v /web

So modifying the example, we end up with this:

    [root@samba /]# ls -Z | grep rhce
    drwxrwsr-x. root rhce unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 rhcefiles
    [root@samba /]# semanage fcontext -a -t samba_share_t "/rhcefiles(/.*)?"
    [root@samba /]# restorecon -R /rhcefiles/
    [root@samba /]# ls -Z | grep rhce
    drwxrwsr-x. root rhce unconfined_u:object_r:samba_share_t:s0 rhcefiles

Now from the client we can use the resource as we would expect:

    [root@client sambashare]# cd
    [root@client ~]# cd /sambashare/
    [root@client sambashare]# ls
    testfile
    [root@client sambashare]# echo lol > testfile 
    [root@client sambashare]# cat testfile 
    lol

## Use Kerberos to authenticate access to shared directories<a name="obj10-3"></a>

The Ubuntu help forums have a good [guide][13] on the subject. The heart of it comes down to editing the `smb.conf` file this way:

    ...
    security = ADS
    realm = KERBEROS_REALM
    encrypt passwords = yes
    #Samba 3.0 requires "kerberos keytab = yes" instead of the next line.
    #Samba < 3.5 might require "kerberos method = system keytab" instead of the next line.
    kerberos method = secrets and keytab
    #optional
    password server = kdc.fdqn
    ...

# SMTP<a name="obj11"></a>

For this section we'll configure postfix.

##Configure a system to forward all email to a central mail server<a name="obj11-1"></a>

CertDepot has a great [guide][12] on this objective which I'll be following here. The important configuration option that we'll specify is the `relayhost` option in postfix's `main.cf` file.

# SSH<a name="obj12"></a>

## Configure key-based authentication<a name="obj12-1"></a>

First, I'll generate a keypair on my local machine:

    steven@jupiter ~> ssh-keygen -C steven@pequeno.in
    steven@jupiter ~> ls .ssh/ | grep net
    netserv
    netserv.pub

Now on the server, I'll make the `.ssh` folder which will hold my public key.

    [root@netserv ~]# mkdir .ssh; cd $_
    [root@netserv .ssh]# vim authorized_keys 
    [root@netserv .ssh]# cat authorized_keys 
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3...iQ1 steven@pequeno.in

And now I can log into the remote machine without a password:

    steven@jupiter ~> ssh root@166.78.138.20
    Last login: Wed Nov 26 00:19:33 2014 from jupiter
    [root@netserv ~]# 

## Configure additional options described in documentation<a name="obj12-2"></a>

There are a lot of various things we can do to configure SSH, but let's discuss making our server more secure.

    [root@netserv ~]# vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
    PermitRootLogin no
    PasswordAuthentication no

We should not allow the `root` account to be accessed locally. By disabling this we can make sure that an attacker does not have an easy target to brute force. 

We should disable password authentication all together. We should also use something like [fail2ban][6] to make sure that an attacker is blocked from making too many failed attempts against the server. But even without fail2ban we can make sure passwords cannot be guessed.

Most ssh configurations will be made in this way. Read the configuration file as most options have explanations.

# NTP<a name="obj13"></a>

## Synchronize time using other NTP peers<a name="obj13-1"></a>

When you install NTP it will come with a set of servers already defined. Normally for practice I will comment those out and use another time server. In this example I'm using one provided by the US Naval Observatory.

    [root@netserv ~]# yum install ntp -y
    server navobs1.wustl.edu
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl enable ntpd.service 
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ntpd.service'
    [root@netserv ~]# systemctl start ntpd.service 
    [root@netserv ~]# ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
    ==============================================================================
    *navobs1.wustl.e .GPS.            1 u   37   64    1   31.348   -4.922   0.000
