In September, I am going to take the RHCE exam for RHEL version 6. This is
the first of what I hope to be several more tests in the coming months. I 
want to get my RHCA cert as quickly as possible and want to use the next year
to accomplish this. I'll be writing about the process and as much information
as I can related to obtaining the RHCA.
