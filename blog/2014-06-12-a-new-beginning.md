I have been fortunate in my life to have recognized the few times in the past 
where I knew my life was about to change. In many cases the changes came as part of an
identifiable event like a graduation for example. I've just completed eight weeks at
RackSpace's [Open Cloud Academy](http://opencloudacademy.rackspace.com/) and our
graduation ceremony is scheduled at the end of this month. I feel strongly that
this is the beginning of a new, exciting chapter in my life. This post is to try
to put into words why I feel this way and why I don't believe it is because of
my pending graduation.

These past eight weeks are nearly indescribable; the impact they have already
had on me will stay with me for a lifetime. I have always struggled to find my
place in the world. I understand the various aspects of my character, my passion
for education, my fascination with the internet and a seemingly endless
curiosity for anything technical but it is only now, at the age of thirty, that
I believe that I have found my place. I have tried over the years to apply those
traits to the jobs I've held in the past with little success. It is often
useful to have a set of skills that can augment and hopefully improve the
quality of your work but more often you are hired to do a specific thing. In my
experience the thing I was hired for was not to pour through RFCs and attempt to
understand the underlying structure of the internet. 

This may sound unfamiliar to some, those fortunate souls who found gainful employment
where they got to pursue the thing that animated them at their core. I have not
yet found that in my work life. I feel that I may have found that with RackSpace. As
much as it is the Rackers that I've come to know in these past weeks it is the
general sense of RackSpace as a company that interests me the most.

I want to describe RackSpace as dispassionately as possible but I have to admit
that I'm definitely biased. Having lived in San Antonio for the last thirteen
years I've come to know the city to some degree. The area RackSpace decided to
move it's headquarters ([The Castle][1]) was not known for it's
