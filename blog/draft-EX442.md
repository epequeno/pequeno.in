* Use utilities such as vmstat,iostat,mpstat,sar, gnome-system-monitor, top, powertop and others to analyze and report system and application behavior
* Configure systems to provide performance metrics using utilities such as RRDtool
* Use the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) mechanism to implement restrictions on critical system resources
* Use /proc/sys, sysctl and /sys to examine and modify and set kernel run-time parameters
* Use utilities such as dmesg, dmidecode, x86info, sosreport etc. to profile system hardware configurations
* Analyze system and application behavior using tools such as ps, strace, top and Valgrind
* Configure systems to run SystemTap scripts
* Alter process priorities of both new and existing processes
* Configure systems to support alternate page sizes for applications that use large amounts of memory
* Given multiple versions of applications that perform the same or similar tasks, choose which version of the application to run on a system based on its observed performance characteristics
* Configure disk subsystems for optimal performance using mechanisms such as swap partition placement, I/O scheduling algorithm selection, file system layout and others
* Configure kernel behavior by altering module parameters
* Calculate network buffer sizes based on known quantities such as bandwidth and round-trip time and set system buffer sizes based on those calculations
* Select and configure tuned profiles.
* Manage system resource usage using control groups
*
