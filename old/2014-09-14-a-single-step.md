I'm beginning to study for the [RHCA](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhca "The beast itself"). Five seperate exams, some up to six hours in length all using RHEL7. This is among the biggest personal investments I've ever commited myself to but I feel like now is the right time to attempt something like this. I plan to take the following exams:

* [EX236](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex236-red-hat-certificate-expertise-hybrid-cloud-storage-exam) - Hybrid Cloud Storage
* [EX401](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex401-red-hat-certificate-expertise-enterprise-deployment-and-systems-management-exam) - Enterprise Deployment and Systems Management
* [EX413](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex413-red-hat-certificate-expertise-server-hardening-exam) - Server Hardening 
* [EX436](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex436-red-hat-certificate-expertise-clustering-and-storage-management-exam) - Clustering and Storage Management
* [EX442](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex442-red-hat-certificate-expertise-performance-tuning-exam) - Performance Tuning

Over the course of the next several months I will be writing about the objectives and the process itself to journal my experiences and organize study notes. I hope that they will be useful to others planning to pursue the same certification.
